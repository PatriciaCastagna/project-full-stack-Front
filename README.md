# Task Management Application / Front-End

I created a simple Task Management application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application has the following features: create, read, update, and delete tasks. I implemented user login and logout functionality using JWT (JSON Web Token). Only the logged-in user can view and manage their tasks.
